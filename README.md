# Pokémon Details Fetcher

This Python script leverages the PokéAPI to fetch and display details about Pokémon based on their type. It is designed to handle a large number of requests concurrently using the `concurrent.futures` module and manage potential errors effectively.

## Features

- Fetch details of Pokémon by specific type or all types using command-line arguments.
- Concurrent fetching to improve performance for large datasets.
- Comprehensive error handling for network issues and API errors.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3 and `requests` library installed to run this script.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the script's directory:
   ```bash
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
3. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

## Usage

Run the script from the command line by specifying the Pokémon type:
```bash
python script.py --type water
```

For fetching details of all Pokémon types, use:
```bash
python script.py --type all
```
or simply run without specifying the type:
```bash
python script.py
```

## Function Descriptions

- **fetch_pokemon_types()**: Retrieves available Pokémon types from the API.
- **get_pokemon_by_type(pokemon_type)**: Fetches a list of Pokémon by the specified type.

- **main()**: Handles command-line arguments and orchestrates fetching and displaying of Pokémon details.

## Error Handling

The script includes robust error handling for various potential issues, including network errors, timeouts, and data processing errors, with retries for failed requests.
